# Constraints and Opportunity Properties

Previously, the Constraints and Opportunity Properties were the same concept/representation. However, these represent distinct but related attributes. Constraints represents the terms that can be used in the filter sent to the Opportunities Search and Order Create endpoints. These are frequently the same or related values that will be part of the STAC Items that are used to fulfill an eventual Order. Opportunity Properties represent the expected range of values that these STAC Items are expected to have. An opportunity is a prediction about the future, and as such, the values for the Opportunity are fuzzy. For example, the sun azimuth angle will (likely) be within a predictable range of values, but the exact value will not be known until after the capture occurs. Therefore, it is necessary to describe the Opportunity in a way that describes these ranges.

For example, for the concept of "off_nadir":

The Constraint will be a term "off_nadir" that can be a value 0 to 45.
This is used in a CQL2 filter to the Opportunities Search endpoint to restrict the allowable values from 0 to 15
The Opportunity that is returned from Search has an Opportunity Property "off_nadir" with a description that the value of this field in the resulting STAC Items will be between 4 and 8, which falls within the filter restriction of 0-15.
An Order is created with the original filter and other fields.
The Order is fulfilled with a STAC Item that has an off_nadir value of 4.8.

As of Dec 2024, the STAPI spec says only that the Opportunity Properties must have a datetime interval field `datetime` and a `product_id` field. The remainder of the Opportunity description proprietary is up to the provider to define. The example given this this repo for `off_nadir` is of a custom format with a "minimum" and "maximum" field describing the limits.

## JSON Schema

Another option would be to use either a full JSON Schema definition for an attribute value in the properties (e.g., `schema`) or individual attribute definitions for the properties values. This option should be investigated further in the future.

JSON Schema is a well-defined specification language that can support this type of data description. It is already used as the language for OGC API Queryables to define the constraints on various terms that may be used in CQL2 expressions, and likewise within STAPI for the Constraints that are used in Opportunity Search and the Order Parameters that are set on an order. The use of JSON Schema for Constraints (as with Queryables) is not to specify validation for a JSON document, but rather to well-define a set of typed and otherwise-constrained terms. Similarly, JSON Schema would be used for the Opportunity to define the predicted ranges of properties within the Opportunity that is bound to fulfill an Order.

The geometry is not one of the fields that will be expressed as a schema constraint, since this is part of the Opportunity/Item/Feature top-level. The Opportunity geometry will express both uncertainty about the actual capture area and a “maximum extent” of capture, e.g., a small area within a larger data strip – this is intentionally vague so it can be used to express whatever semantics the provider wants.

The ranges of predicted Opportunity values can be expressed using JSON in the following way: 

- numeric value - number with const, enum, or minimum/maximum/exclusiveMinimum/exclusiveMaximum
- string value - string with const or enum
- datetime - type string using format date-time. The limitation wit this is that these values are not treated with JSON Schema as temporal, but rather a string pattern. As such, there is no formal way to define a temporal interval that the instance value must be within. Instead, we will repurpose the description field as a datetime interval in the same format as a search datetime field, e.g., 2024-01-01T00:00:00Z/2024-01-07T00:00:00Z.  Optionally, the pattern field can be defined if the valid datetime values also match a regular expression, e.g., 2024-01-0[123456]T.*, which while not as useful semantically as the description interval does provide a formal validation of the resulting object, which waving hand might be useful in some way waving hand .

The Item that fulfills and Order placed on this Opportunity might be like:


```json
{
  "type": "Feature",
  ...
  "properties": {
    "datetime": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "sensor_type": "2",
    "craft_id": "7",
    "view:sun_elevation": 30.0,
    "view:azimuth": 105.0,
    "view:off_nadir": 9.0,
    "eo:cloud_cover": 10.0
  }
}
```
